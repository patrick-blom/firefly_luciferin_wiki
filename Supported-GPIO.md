**Luciferin** supports three different GPIO:
- GPIO2
- GPIO5 (recommended for ESP8266, differently from GPIO2, GPIO5 is not shared with built in LED)
- GPIO16 

GPIO can be changed on the fly on both Light and Full firmware from the `Firefly Luciferin` settings.

## How to change the GPIO in use?

From the "devices" tab, double click on the GPIO you want to change, press enter.
