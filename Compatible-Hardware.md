Thanks to [Arduino Boostrapper](https://github.com/sblantipodi/arduino_bootstrapper) it can run on a lot of devices but if you want to run of a different board than ESP8266, you need to manually compile the firmware.

## LED Strip WS2812B 5V
60 LEDs per meter is generally bright enough for most applications and does not require a lot of power.

## Power supply for the LED strip
You need a [5V power supply](https://it.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20200731160904&SearchText=5v+power+supply)
You need to buy a power supply capable of powering all the LEDs you want. For 60 LEDs a power supply of at least 5V/3A it's recommended, for 120 LEDs you need a 5V/6A power supply, do you math here.
A bigger power supply generally works better and runs less hot than a smaller one. **Don't undersize the power supply**.
