[**Glow Worm Luciferin**](https://github.com/sblantipodi/glow_worm_luciferin) is a firmware designed for **ESP8266 microcontrollers**.  

Thanks to [Arduino Boostrapper](https://github.com/sblantipodi/arduino_bootstrapper) it can run on a lot of devices but if you want to run of a different board than ESP8266, you need to manually compile the firmware.
